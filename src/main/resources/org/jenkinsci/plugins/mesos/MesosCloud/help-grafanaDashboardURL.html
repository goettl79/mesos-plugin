    http://HOST:PORT/dashboard where a Grafana Dasboard is actually hosted.. Jenkins will automatically add a "var-slave" and a "var-container" parameter to the dashboard URL.
    If the URL is given, Jenkins will include an iframe which opens this URL on the Mesos-Slave status overview.
    Jenkins will also print this URL with parameters at the end of a build in its logfile.
